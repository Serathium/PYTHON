# About:  
Project1 and Project2 were my first attempts at QA Automation with the guidance of Gemini AI. I will learn the basics and implement them in my next projects.  

## Project1  
Uses **Playwright**, **Pytest** and a **JSON** file to automate Browser UI QA tests, utilizing saucedemo.com as testing grounds. Utilizes **CI/CD**, testing the code in Github actions everytime there's a pull request or push.

## Project2
Uses **Pytest**, **Requests** and a **JSON** file to automate API QA test, utilizing saucedemo.com as testing grounds. Utilizes **CI/CD**, testing the code in Github actions everytime there's a pull request or push.
